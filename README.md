# Operation System Study


**'Operating System'** is one of the basic computer science subjects in college.



As a programmer without CS degree, I have decided to study OS and to store what I get so I can easily pull out what I have learned when needed.



All the archives are written based on the on-line lecture called 'Fast Campus' (https://www.fastcampus.co.kr/).
