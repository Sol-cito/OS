# Operation System Study


**'Operating System'** is one of the basic computer science subjects in college.



As a programmer without CS degree, I have decided to study OS and would like to share the knowledges I get, and to remind me later of what I have learned.



The study resource is from on-line lecture website called 'Fast Campus' (https://www.fastcampus.co.kr/).
